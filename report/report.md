## Abstract


Big data in sports is being used more and more as technology advances and this has a very big impact, especially when it comes to sports gambling. Sports gambling has been around for a while and it is gaining popularity with it being legalized in more places across the world. It is a very lucrative industry and the bookmakers use everything they can to make sure the overall odds are in their favor so they can reduce the risk of paying out to the betters and ensure a steady return. Sports statistics and data is more important than ever to bookmakers to come up with the odds they put out to the public. Odds are no longer just determined by expert analyzers for a specific sport. The compilation of odds uses a lot of historical data about team and player performance and looks at the most intricate details in order to ensure accuracy. Bookmakers spend a lot of money to employ the best statisticians and the best algorithms. There are also many companies that solely focus on sports data analysis, who often work with bookmakers around the world. On the other hand, big data for sports game analysis are also used by gamblers to gain a competitive edge. Many different algorithms have been created by researchers and gamblers to try to beat the bookmakers, some more successful than others. Oftentimes these not only involve examining sports data, but also analysing data from different bookmakers odds in order to determine the best bets to place. Overall, big data is very important in this field and this research paper aims to show the various techniques that are used by different stakeholders.

## 1. Introduction 

Big Data in sports has been used for years by various stakeholders in this inidustry to do everything from predicting game outcomes to injury prevention. It is also becoming very prevelant in the area of sports gambling. Ever since the Supreme court decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association that overturned a ban on sports betting, the majorirty of states in the US have passed legislation to allow sports gambling [^1]. In 2019, the global sports betting market was valued at 85.047 US Dollars so this is an already very big industry that is expanding [^2]. There are various platforms that allow betting in this industry including tangible sports books, casinos, racetracks, and many online and mobile gambling apps. The interesting thing about big data in sports betting is that it is being used on both sides in this market. It is used by bookmakers to create game models and come up with different spreads and odds, but big data analysis is also being used by gamblers to gain a competetive advantage and place more accurate bets. Various prediction models using machine learning and big data analytics have been created and they can sometimes be very accurate. For example, Google correctly predicted 14 out of the 16 matches in the 2014 world cup and Microsoft did even better by corretly predicting 15 out of the 16 matches during that year [^8]. Many big companies have spent a lot of time gathering lots of data and creating prediction algorithms inlcuding ESPN's Football Power index that gives the probility of one team beating another, Analytics Powerhouse 538 that determines scores of games using their ELO method, and Accuscore which runs Mone Carlo Simulations on worldwide sporting events [^15]. Bookmakers use all their possible tools and algorithms to put out the best odds that will give them a return. They often employ teams of statastitions that use the most advanced prediction models and information from data analysis companies to come up with their odds. If sports data analysis is vastly being used by people other than bookies and prediction models can often be very accurate, one might wonder how people haven't made millions off sports betting and how bookmakers are still in business? This report aims to analyze how big data analytics are used by bookmakers to come up with the odds they put out for games while also examining how it is used by the other side. It aims to analysize various prediction models created by sports betters, researchers, and AI companies, and see how they compare to the way big data is used by bookmakers. Besides giving an analysis of how big data is used in this field, it aims to show if betting guided by prediction models can give a consistent return. 

## 2. Background


Many people with an interest in sports betting prediction have created models, some that involve machine learning and AI. A few of these projects have had some very interesting results using different types of data and analysis techniques. Jordan Bailey created an NBA prediction model based on the over under bets [^12]. For context, bookmakers will set a point total for a game and bettors can bet on whether the actual score will be over or under the point total set by the book. This type of betting is offered for many types of sports. Using NBA box scores for 5 previous seasons and data on historical betting lines created by various bookmakers, Bailey created a logistical regression model that would return a prediction on if the score was over or under a point total set by a bookmaker. Two models were created, one that predicted if a game would be over a set line and one that predicted if it would be under a set line. The datasets for these models were structured in a way where each specific game was represented as the box scores for the 3 previous games for each team, so 6 previous games [^12]. When creating the model, the first four seasons were used as the training set and the fifth season was used as the testing data to make predictions on [^13]. In order to determine the significance of results, Bailey set up a "confidence threshold" of 62 percent for the probability his model returned on a game being over or under. The prediction was "confident" if the probability of the prediction was above the set threshold. When testing the models, the over model predicted 88 games confidently and 52 games correctly, with an accuracy of 59.09 percent. The under model predicted 96 games confidently and correctly predicted 52 games with an accuracy of 54.16 percent [^12]. To simulate how the model would perform on betting with 10,000 dollars, a bet was made every time the model predicted a confident bet for the 2018 NBA season. The accuracy on the bets were 52.52 percent and the total after the simulation was 11,880 dollars. 



## 3. How bookmakes Determine odds

It is no secret that bookmakers use a lot of data and apply various statistical techniques to come up with betting odds. The statistical techniques used and the data that bookmakers look at vary from sport to sport, for example, a popular method for modeling soccer uses the poisson distribution since it can be very accurate but also because it makes it easy to add time decay to the inputs [^3]. Data and data accuracy plays such a big part for bookmakers that many comapanies in the sports betting market have multi million dollar contracts with big leagues like the NFL [^10]. The NBA also recently extended their contracts with Sportradar and Genius Sports group that will have the rights to distrubute official NBA data to licences sports betting operators in the United States [^11]. Companies like Sportradar collect and anlyize official data and provide services to various bookmakers. The accuracy of data can be very important, a difference of something as little as one yard can make such a big difference; therefore, the industry values the accuracy of data that the leagues itself can provide. Bookmakers employ various mathematicians to analyze historical sports data to come up with odds; however, sports data isnâ€™t the only thing that bookmakers look at when determining how they will make odds for a game. At the end of the day, the gamlbing industry is a numbers game that thrives on ensuring the probability is in the houses favor. Bookmakers use various techniques involving big data in order to do so. 

Big data is being used more and more in various industries, and in the gambling industry, it isn't just used to come up with odds. One major way it is used is by gathering data about user demographics [^4]. When using an online sportsbook, the casino can gather data about a users age, location, gender, excetera which can provide valuable insights that can be used for product development and marketing purposes. By using user demographic data to provide targeted advertising, casinos and bookmakers can attract more betters which will increase revenue. As said by former odds compiler Matthew Trenhaile, "Their [bookmakers] product is entertainment and not the selling of an intellectual contest between punter and bookmaker. It is foolish to think this has ever been the product that bookmakers have sold.They sell an adrenaline rush and anyone who thinks great characters pitting themselves against the punters and taking anyone on in horse racing betting rings is what betting used to be about is kidding himself or herself." Due to the probability of making money in sports betting, and really every type of gambling, being in the houses favor, online casinos and sportsbooks use big data to increase the number of bets placed by customers. Nevertheless, using models to come up with odds is the heart of this industry which makes it the most important way big data analytics is used by bookmakers.
	
When odds are being made for a sports book, a lot of things are taken into consideration in the process. Bookmakers have teams of statisticians that analyze historical data of the teams in order to come up with game prediction models, often using machine learning based algorithms[^5]. When bookmakers are actually making the odds, these statistical models created from large amounts of data aren't the only thing they use. When bookmakers are creating odds, their goal isn't to come up with an accurate game prediction, it is to have the lowest probability of paying out, so they will also use public opinion along with their statistical models to do this. For example, if a team has been on an unexpected winning streak the bookmakers will often overestimate their odds, even against a team that will statistically do better than them, since people will be more inclined to take that bet resulting in the bookmaker making more money if the team the models favored wins [^6]. Furthermore, bookmakers will often "hedge" bets to cover potential losses if an unexpected outcome occurs. For example, if a large amount of people are betting on a team regardless of the odds, the bookmakers will have a large payout if that outcome occurs, so they will start offering more favorable odds on the opposite outcome so they can bring in bets that would cover their losses [^5]. 





## 5. Poisson Model


One of the most popular models for soccer game predictions is the Poisson distribution model. According to former odds compiler Matthew Trenhaile, the Poisson distribution model for soccer prediction can be very accurate and is very useful since it is easy to add time decay to the inputs [^3]. Refinements can easily be made as a game progresses and goal input changes to easily re calculate the odds, which is useful for bookmakers. The Poisson distribution for soccer game predictions is not only used on a large scale by bookmakers to calculate odds, but it is also often used by even small time bettors to determine how they will bet. A Poisson model for soccer games can even be created on Excel for betters who want to place their bets more accurately. This process works by using historical data of how many goals a team scored and how many goals they let in and comparing it to a leagues average in order to determine the number of goals each team is likely to score in a game. It starts with calculating the average number of goals scored for home games and away games for the whole league and determining a team's "attack strength" and "defense strength" [^14]. The attack strength is a team's average number of goals per game divided by the league average of goals per game. Similarly, a teams defense strength is determined by dividing a teams average number of goals conceded by the leagues average number of goals conceded. The goal expectancy for the home team is calculated by multiplying the team's attack strength with the away team's defense strength and the league's average number of home goals. The goal expectancy for the away team is calculated by multiplying the away teams attack strength with the home teams defense strength and multiplying it by the leagues average number of away goals [^14]. With this information, one can determine the probability for the range of goal outcomes on both sides using a formula created by the french mathematician Simeon Denis Poisson. The formula for this is P(x events in interval) = (e-Î¼) (Î¼x) / x! . This formula determines the probability of the number of goals being scored (x) using Eulerâ€™s number (e) and the goal expectancy (Î¼). With this formula, we can see the probability each team has for scoring a number of goals in a game. Usually the distribution is done for 0-5 goals to see the percentages of each team scoring on the goal interval. This can be used by bookmakers to determine the odds and by gamblers to make well educated bets. 


## 6. Algorithms and prediction models

Gamblers often use various models, driven by big data, in order to help them place more accurate bets. Many different models have been created in the sports field that use factors such as historical sports data in order to come up with game prediction models. In research done by Manuel Silvero, he studied 5 famous algorithms that used Nueral Network and Machine learning and concluded that their accuracy varies from 50-70 percent, depending on the sport [^7]. Purucker in 1996 was one of the first computational sports prediction model and used an Artificial Nueral Network with backward propogation [^9]. It was 61 percent accurate. In 2003, Khan expanded Puruckers work and was more acurate. Data on 208 matches was collected and the elements used were total yardage differential, rushing yardage differential, turnover differential, away team indicator and home team indicator [^9]. The first 192 matches of the season were used as the training data set for the model. When tested on the remaining games of the season, the models predicted at a 75 percent accuracy. This was compared to predictions created by 8 ESPN sportscasters for the same games and they only predicted 63 percent of those matches correctly. 



One of the most accurate models created, in terms of receiving  a good return on a bet, was created by Lisandro Kaunitz of the University of Tokyo, and relied on data from odds that boomkmakers put out rather than historical game data [^6]. When it comes to stastical models for sports, big data from historical sports games are often analyzed in order to come up with game predictions and to gain insight on things like team, player, and position performance. In the market of sports betting, these models are used to come up with odds and also by bettors to place bets. Gamblers have often tried different game prediction models in order to beat the books, but sucess if very rare since bookmakers employ various statisticians and data analysis experts in order to come up with the best game prediction models [^6]. Kaunitz created a model that focused on analysing data of the odds created by bookmakers, rather than sports team data, to predict good bets to place. The basis of his model relied on a tehcnique bookmakers use to reduce their payout risk, known as hedging. This concept and the way bookmakers use it to reduce their risk of payout is covered in section 3. Kaunitz betting model worked by gathering the odds for a game created by various bookmakers and determining the average odds available. Using statistical analysis of odds offered, Kaunitz was able to determine any outliers from the average odds for a game [^6]. Using these outliers, Kaunitz could determine if a bet would favor them or not. After varous simulations and models, Kaunitz's and his team took their strategy into the real world, and their bets payed out 47.2 percent of the time. They received an 8.5 percent return and profited $957.50 in 265 bets [^6]. Due to their impressive returns, bookmakers caught on and started to limit the amount that they could bet
