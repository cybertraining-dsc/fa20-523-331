## 1. Introduction 

Big Data in sports has been used for years by various stakeholders in this inidustry to do everything from predicting game outcomes to injury prevention. It is also becoming very prevelant in the area of sports gambling. Ever since the Supreme court decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association that overturned a ban on sports betting, the majorirty of states in the US have passed legislation to allow sports gambling [^1]. In 2019, the global sports betting market was valued at 85.047 US Dollars so this is an already very big industry that is expanding [^2]. There are various platforms that allow betting in this industry including tangible sports books, casinos, racetracks, and many online and mobile gambling apps. The interesting thing about big data in sports betting is that it is being used on both sides in this market. It is used by bookmakers to create game models and come up with different spreads and odds, but big data analysis is also being used by gamblers to gain a competetive advantage and place more accurate bets. Various prediction models using machine learning and big data analytics have been created and they often are very accurate. For example, Google correctly predicted 14 out of the 16 matches in the 2014 world cup and Microsoft did even better by corretly predicting 15 out of the 16 matches during that year [^8]. Bookmakers use all their possible tools and algorithms to put out the best odds that will give them a return. They often employ teams of statastitions and use the most advanced prediction models to come up with their odds. If sports data analysis is vastly being used by people other than bookies and prediction models can often be very accurate, one might wonder how people haven't made millions off sports betting and how bookmakers are still in business? This report aims to analyze how big data analytics are used by bookmakers to come up with the odds they put out for games while also examining how it is used by the other side. It aims to analysize various prediction models created by sports betters, researchers, and AI companies, and see how they compare to the way big data is used by bookmakers. Besides giving an analysis of how big data is used in this field, it aims to show if betting guided by prediction models can give a consistent return. 

## 2. Background







## 3. How bookmakes Determine odds

It is no secret that bookmakers use a lot of data and apply various statistical techniques to come up with betting odds. The statistical techniques used and the data that bookmakers look at vary from sport to sport, for example, a popular method for modeling soccer uses the poisson distribution since it can be very accurate but also because it makes it easy to add time decay to the inputs [^3]. Data and data accuracy plays such a big part for bookmakers that many comapanies in the sports betting market have multi million dollar contracts with big leagues like the NFL [^10]. The NBA also recently extended their contracts with Sportradar and Genius Sports group that will have the rights to distrubute official NBA data to licences sports betting operators in the United States [^11]. Companies like Sportradar collect and anlyize official data and provide services to various bookmakers. The accuracy of data can be very important, a difference of something as little as one yard can make such a big difference; therefore, the industry values the accuracy of data that the leagues itself can provide. Bookmakers employ various mathematicians to analyze historical sports data to come up with odds; however, sports data isn’t the only thing that bookmakers look at when determining how they will make odds for a game. At the end of the day, the gamlbing industry is a numbers game that thrives on ensuring the probability is in the houses favor. Bookmakers use various techniques involving big data in order to do so. 

Big data is being used more and more in various industries, and in the gambling industry, it isn't just used to come up with odds. One major way it is used is by gathering data about user demographics [^4]. When using an online sportsbook, the casino can gather data about a users age, location, gender, excetera which can provide valuable insights that can be used for product development and marketing purposes. By using user demographic data to provide targeted advertising, casinos and bookmakers can attract more betters which will increase revenue. As said by former odds compiler Matthew Trenhaile, "Their [bookmakers] product is entertainment and not the selling of an intellectual contest between punter and bookmaker. It is foolish to think this has ever been the product that bookmakers have sold.They sell an adrenaline rush and anyone who thinks great characters pitting themselves against the punters and taking anyone on in horse racing betting rings is what betting used to be about is kidding himself or herself." Due to the probability of making money in sports betting, and really every type of gambling, being in the houses favor, online casinos and sportsbooks use big data to increase the number of bets placed by customers. Nevertheless, using models to come up with odds is the heart of this industry which makes it the most important way big data analytics is used by bookmakers.
	
When odds are being made for a sports book, a lot of things are taken into consideration in the process. Bookmakers have teams of statisticians that analyze historical data of the teams in order to come up with game prediction models, often using machine learning based algorithms[^5]. When bookmakers are actually making the odds, these statistical models created from large amounts of data aren't the only thing they use. When bookmakers are creating odds, their goal isn't to come up with an accurate game prediction, it is to have the lowest probability of paying out, so they will also use public opinion along with their statistical models to do this. For example, if a team has been on an unexpected winning streak the bookmakers will often overestimate their odds, even against a team that will statistically do better than them, since people will be more inclined to take that bet resulting in the bookmaker making more money if the team the models favored wins [^6]. Furthermore, bookmakers will often "hedge" bets to cover potential losses if an unexpected outcome occurs. For example, if a large amount of people are betting on a team regardless of the odds, the bookmakers will have a large payout if that outcome occurs, so they will start offering more favorable odds on the opposite outcome so they can bring in bets that would cover their losses [^5].

## 6. Algorithms and prediction models

Gamblers often use various models, driven by big data, in order to help them place more accurate bets. Many different models have been created in the sports field that use factors such as historical sports data in order to come up with game prediction models. In research done by Manuel Silvero, he studied 5 famous algorithms that used Nueral Network and Machine learning and concluded that their accuracy varies from 50-70 percent, depending on the sport [^7]. Purucker in 1996 was one of the first computational sports prediction model and used an Artificial Nueral Network with backward propogation [^9]. It was 61 percent accurate. In 2003, Khan expanded Puruckers work and was more acurate. Data on 208 matches was collected and the elements used were total yardage differential, rushing yardage differential, turnover differential, away team indicator and home team indicator [^9]. The first 192 matches of the season were used as the training data set for the model. When tested on the remaining games of the season, the models predicted at a 75 percent accuracy. This was compared to predictions created by 8 ESPN sportscasters for the same games and they only predicted 63 percent of those matches correctly. 



One of the most accurate models created, in terms of recieving a good return on a bet, was created by Lisandro Kaunitz of the University of Tokyo, and relied on data from odds that boomkmakers put out rather than historical game data [^6]. When it comes to stastical models for sports, big data from historcal sports games are often analyized in order to come up with game predictions and to gain insight on things like team, player, and position performance. In the market of sports betting, these models are used to come up with odds and also by bettors to place bets. Gamblers have often tried different game prediction models in order to beat the books, but sucess if very rare since bookmakers employe various statasticions and data analysis experts in order to come up with the best game prediction models [^6]. Kaunitz created a model that focused on analysing data of the odds created by bookmakers, rather than sports team data, to predict good bets to place. The basis of his model relied on a tehcnique bookmakers use to reduce their payout risk, known as hedging. This concept and the way bookmakers use it to reduce their risk of payout is covered in section 3. Kaunitz betting model worked by gathering the odds for a game created by various bookmakers and determining the average odds availible. Using statistical analysis of odds offered, Kaunitz was able to determine any outliers from the average odds for a game [^6]. Using these outliers, Kaunitz could determine if a bet would favor them or not. After varous simulations and models, Kaunitz's and his team took their strategy into the real world, and their bets payed out 47.2 percent of the time. They received an 8.5 percent return and profited $957.50 in 265 bets [^6]. Due to their impressive returns, bookmakers caught on and started to limit the amount that they could bet
